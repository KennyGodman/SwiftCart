# 🛒 SwiftCart

SwiftCart is an agentic, Web3-native luxury storefront built on Circle's **Arc L1 Blockchain** utilizing **USDC stablecoin** payments. Shoppers can browse, customize, and purchase luxury items either manually or through an **Autonomous AI Shopping Agent** powered by ERC-8183 escrow agreements.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🤖 **Autonomous AI Shopping Agent**: Chat with a natural language agent that can search the catalogue, manage your cart, and execute checkout transactions autonomously once allowance is approved.
- ⚡ **Arc L1 Blockchain Integration**: Complete USDC transactions with sub-second finality, gas verification, and native wallet network switching (MetaMask/Rabby).
- 🔒 **ERC-8183 Trustless Escrow**: Built-in consumer protection. Payments are held in smart contract escrow and released to the merchant only after you confirm delivery.
- 🌓 **Premium Dark/Light Theme**: A stunning UI theme toggle featuring smooth transitions and spring-physics knobs.
- 👔 **Organized Fashion Subdivisions**: Clean storefront organization separating fashion items into **Shirts**, **Trousers**, **Belts**, **Caps**, and **Shoes**—each cleanly grouped into **Men**, **Women**, and **Kids** sections.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+) and [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) installed.

### 💻 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KennyGodman/ARCWEAR.git
   cd ARCWEAR
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install smart contract libraries**:
   ```bash
   forge install
   ```

4. **Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root based on `.env.example`:
   ```env
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```

### 🏃 Running Locally

To run the Vite dev server locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open **`http://localhost:5173`** (or the port specified in console) in your browser. Ensure your wallet extension (MetaMask/Rabby) is switched to **Arc Testnet** to test blockchain transactions.

### 🧪 Testing Smart Contracts

To run the Solidity unit tests using Foundry:
```bash
forge test
```
To check test coverage:
```bash
forge coverage
```
